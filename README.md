# Cryptography
In this project of the cryptography, we are going to see that how we can hide our data. With the help of the different algorithm.  The Caesar Cipher algorithm for cryptography is one of the oldest algorithms.   Now much newer algorithms have arrived that are much more secure, however in terms of speed of execution Caesar cipher algorithm is still the fastest owing to its simplicity. However, the algorithm is extremely easy to crack. This is because in this algorithm each character of a message is always replaced by the same fixed character that has been predetermined. To improve the algorithm and enhance its security feature, a few changes can be added.
